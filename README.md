This project is an up-to-date interactive website that uses data from Johns Hopkins University to display a snapshot of the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide followed by an interactive list of the countries in descending order of total confirmed cases per country

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
